This folder will contain an Expo React Native app scaffolded for the Delivery Partner app.

Next steps (locally):
1. cd delivery-p/expo-app
2. npx create-expo-app . --template blank
3. npm install
4. expo start

I will now add the core files for navigation, firebase realtime setup, and initial screens according to the prompt pack.
